# UsHolidays
Java program that accepts a date as user input (yyyy-mm-dd) and checks the SQLite database to see if it is a holiday or a regular day.

Please install (if possible IntelliJ) as well as have the sqlite drivers to be able to run the program through IntelliJ.

It took me to write this code about 4 hours. I have used SQLITE Database and the output of the program is in a JSON format.
